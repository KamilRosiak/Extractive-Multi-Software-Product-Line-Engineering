 * This interface must be implemented by all sub-Controllers used by MobileMedia.
 * It is for the Chain of Responsibility design pattern, and defined two methods.
 * The entry point to handle a command using the implementing controller is the 
 * postCommand() method. postCommand() calls handleCommand, which will return True 
 * if the current controller has handled the command. handleCommand will return false otherwise.
 * If handleCommand returns false, then postCommand will attempt to call the next controller
 * in the chain, if one exists.
