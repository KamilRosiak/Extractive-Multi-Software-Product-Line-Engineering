 * This is the abstract base messaging class. (At the moment, no messaging classes are implemented)
 * It is used for communication between the device and a network. Generally to upload or 
 * download data such as photos to the application. Currently, the prototype just loads data
 * from the jar file directly.
 * Specific messaging classes that use different protocols should implement this class 
 * (ie. SMS messaging, HTTP messaging, Infrared, Bluetooth etc.)
